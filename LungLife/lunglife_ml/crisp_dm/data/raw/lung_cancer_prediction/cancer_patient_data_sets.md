### About Dataset

Lung Cancer Prediction
Air Pollution, Alcohol, Smoking & Risk of Lung Cancer
About this dataset

This dataset contains information on patients with lung cancer, including their age, gender, air pollution exposure, alcohol use, dust allergy, occupational hazards, 
genetic risk, chronic lung disease, balanced diet, obesity, smoking, passive smoker, chest pain, coughing of blood, fatigue, weight loss ,shortness of breath ,wheezing ,
swallowing difficulty ,clubbing of finger nails and snoring

### How to use the dataset

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for 1.59 million deaths in 2018. The majority of lung cancer cases are attributed to smoking, 
but exposure to air pollution is also a risk factor. A new study has found that air pollution may be linked to an increased risk of lung cancer, even in nonsmokers.

The study, which was published in the journal Nature Medicine, looked at data from over 462,000 people in China who were followed for an average of six years. 
The participants were divided into two groups: those who lived in areas with high levels of air pollution and those who lived in areas with low levels of air pollution.

The researchers found that the people in the high-pollution group were more likely to develop lung cancer than those in the low-pollution group. They also found that the 
risk was higher in nonsmokers than smokers, and that the risk increased with age.

While this study does not prove that air pollution causes lung cancer, it does suggest that there may be a link between the two. More research is needed to confirm these 
findings and to determine what effect different types and levels of air pollution may have on lung cancer risk

### Research Ideas

predicting the likelihood of a patient developing lung cancer
identifying risk factors for lung cancer
determining the most effective treatment for a patient with lung cancer
### About this file

This dataset contains information on patients with lung cancer, including their age, gender, air pollution exposure, alcohol use, dust allergy, occupational hazards, genetic risk, chronic lung disease, balanced diet, obesity, smoking status, passive smoker status, chest pain, coughing of blood, fatigue levels , weight loss , shortness of breath , wheezing , swallowing difficulty , clubbing of finger nails , frequent colds , dry coughs , and snoring. By analyzing this data we can gain insight into what causes lung cancer and how best to treat it
